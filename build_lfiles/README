This directory contains:
build_lfiles: code for converting raw correlator output (O-files) to more conventional L-files
read_mwac: decodes O-files like build_lfiles, but writes output stream to a pipe
uvcompress: compress O-files

Requires: cfitsio, openmp

to build:
make

to install:
make install    # to install to /usr/local/bin
make prefix=<basedir> install   # to install elsewhere

where basedir is something like /usr/local or $HOME. It creates a subdir (if necessary) called bin and puts the programs in there.
